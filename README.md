# Optical-Plant-Identification-for-Farming-Vehicles
The main Objective of the project is to build a prototype of an optical plant detector which is to be attached to farming vehicles for detection of Rumex Acetosa using Machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project is to be implemented an image detection model on Raspberry pi 4. The whole system is mounted on to a farming vehicle which is then used by farmers for detecting Rumex Acetosa and eliminating them.

The pi camera is used for capturing the visuals of the field and feed them to raspberry pi. The methods used for the plant detection are machine learning and deep learning techniques. The object detection is achieved by training a deep learning model with the custom dataset of the plant ‘Rumex Acetosa’.
