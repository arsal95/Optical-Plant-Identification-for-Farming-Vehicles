# Optical-Plant-Identification-for-Farming-Vehicles
The project aims at the precise optical detection of the plant ‘Rumex Acetosa’ using image processing techniques so that it can be excluded from the fodder given to the cattle, by eliminating them using manual or automated application of weedicides. The detection procedure is done with the help of a camera attached on to a farming vehicle. Deep learning aided Image processing technique is used in the project and it is one of the most advanced methods of object detection. the system is implemented on raspberry pi model 4 and visuals are captured using the pi camera.
